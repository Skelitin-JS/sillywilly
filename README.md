# sillywilly
SillyWilly is a basic template discord bot written in python.
To use it yourself, make sure you have python installed, then in your terminal type:
`pip install discord`
After doing this, create a file named token_1 and in that file, write the following code:
`TOKEN = 'your token'`
and replace "your token" with your discord bot token
